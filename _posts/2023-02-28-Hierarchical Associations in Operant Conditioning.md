Real world tasks and activities by organisms involve complex combination of subtasks. It also involves choices among long or short term rewards pertaining 
to those subtasks. Operant conditioning is one of the key learning mechanisms for problem solving where organisms learn to associate a response (R) and a 
specific outcome (O), which is also termed as R-O association. The studies have involved simple tasks involving single response mapped to an outcome or multiple responses that 
lead to a particular outcome. All these studies included the animals to be trained using chaining and shaping techniques. However, the neural mechanisms 
that can explain complex goal directed behaviours are unknown. One interesting study that explains a key aspect in complex problem solving is by Trask et al.(2014).
Their study has demonstrated the effects of learning context on operant conditioning. They found that the response was reduced when there was a context switch. This was in constrast with results commonly observed in classical conditioning, where 
the conditioned stimulus often maintains its ability to evoke conditioned responding outside of the original learning context. Their work shows that there 
exists a possibility of a hierarchical context and R-O association that is learnt in different contexts. Interestingly, this insight has been explored to 
computationally model complex problem-solving using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) (Eppe(2022)) and there are supporting neural correlates 
for HRL in humans (Diuk(2013)) as well.
