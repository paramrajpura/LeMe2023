Continuing our learning on the lifelong learning mechanisms ...

Here are a few more short descriptions of the biological mechanisms that support lifelong learning :

Neuromodulation:
Neuromodulation is a process in which neurotransmitters released by neurons have local and global effects on activity and plasticity. It has been studied in the context of behavioral adaptation in the presence of expected and unexpected uncertainties. Different neuromodulators have selective effects on learning, and uncertainty triggers transformation and learning. 

Context gating:
Context plays a significant role in modulating, filtering, and assimilating new information in biological systems. Context gating, the selective enabling of subpopulations of neurons, helps reduce interference between similar experiences. Observations of humans with prefrontal cortical lesions, neuroimaging studies, and animal experiments suggest that the prefrontal cortex and connected regions are critical in encoding, storing, and utilizing mental schemas, and context-dependent behavioral strategies.

Reconfigurable organisms:
Biological organisms can adapt and maintain functionality despite changing environments and properties. Examples include tadpoles with an eye on their tail still exhibiting efficient visual learning and rearranging their face to become normal frogs despite abnormal positions of craniofacial organs. Planarian flatworms can regenerate an entire body from fragments, and bioelectric circuits can learn from experience and maintain global anatomical information. Cells and tissues can also be reconfigured into new organisms with coherent morphologies and behavior. Additionally, living bodies can remodel brain tissue while maintaining information content.

It's certainly not the exhaustive list, and many more mechanisms would be discovered. Biological mechanisms are a great pathway to explore the underlying intelligence!
