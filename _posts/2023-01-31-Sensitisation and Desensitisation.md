Often we tend to accidently drink a hot deverage that burns our tongue. Later that day, we tend to be careful even though we are drinking relatively 
colder drinks. This behavior describes (partially!! more about this later..) the process of sensitisation. When an arousing stimulus leads to an increased reponse to later stimulus, 
it is called sensitisation. Although this may sound like dishabituation, but its important to note that while dishabituation corresponds to 
only a particular type of stimuli that was previously habituated, sensitisation is generalised and applicable to any stimuli.Desensitisation is the decreased response to repeated stimuli, however the process is found to be different from habituation. 

Pre-pulse inhibition, which can also be explained by desensitization, is observed when a low-intensity stimulus presented before a loud, startling noise reduces the impact of loud noise compared to the impact when a loud noise is presented separately. Interestingly, there is a process called pre-pulse facilitation where a low-intensity stimulus presented 500ms earlier than the loud noise can facilitate the response to loud noise. The studies suggest that the pre-pulse inhibition is due to sensorimotor gating. It is a filtering mechanism that helps prevent sensory information overload in order to ensure information processing. The pre-pulse inhibition could also act as an objective measure for the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders since studies have demonstrated pre-pulse inhibition deficits in schizophrenic patients.
