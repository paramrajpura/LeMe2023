Often we tend to accidently drink a hot deverage that burns our tongue. Later that day, we tend to be careful even though we are drinking relatively 
colder drinks. This behavior describes (partially!! more about this later..) the process of sensitisation. When an arousing stimulus leads to an increased reponse to later stimulus, 
it is called sensitisation. Although this may sound like dishabituation, but its important to note that while dishabituation corresponds to 
only a particular type of stimuli that was previously habituated, sensitisation is generalised and applicable to any stimuli.

Desensitisation is the decreased response to repeated stimuli, however the process is found to be different from habituation.
