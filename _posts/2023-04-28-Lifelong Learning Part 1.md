It's interesting if you notice how we are capable of continually learning. The thought led me to explore a few biological mechanisms that enable continuous learning without forgetting the previous learnings.

Here's a short introduction to biological mechanisms that support lifelong learning :

Neurogenesis:
Neurogenesis is the process of producing new neurons in the central nervous system. It occurs throughout life, with examples such as olfactory interneurons being produced in mice. The rate of neurogenesis is higher when exposed to a wider variety of experiences, suggesting a role in scaling up the number of memories that can be stored. It also plays a vital role during infant development to accommodate new information and skills. Insects exhibit extreme adaptability through neurogenesis and synaptogenesis to match increasing processing demands while preserving learned responses during metamorphosis.

Replay:
Replay is a phenomenon where neuronal activity patterns that occur during waking hours are replayed during sleep or rest. Initially observed in the hippocampus, it was later found synchronously in the hippocampus and neocortical areas. The replay process is believed to play a critical role in memory consolidation in the brain. While the dual memory model is accepted as the core principle of how the brain learns declarative memories, the brain uses other memory models, such as procedural memories, which can be learned without forgetting old skills. REM sleep is thought to have an important role in such learning, and dreams during REM sleep help with generalization.

Metaplasticity:
The brain's ability to store memories is known as synaptic plasticity. However, the ease with which a synapse can be strengthened or weakened can vary over time, known as metaplasticity. This ability depends on the internal biochemical states of the synapse, which in turn depends on the history of synaptic modifications and recent neural activity. Metaplasticity has been shown to have several functions in memory maintenance, including mitigating catastrophic forgetting and regulating overall neural excitability. The limited precision of biological synaptic weights poses severe restrictions on memory capacity. Still, the complexity of biological synapses can contribute to solving the stability-plasticity dilemma by allowing for temporary modifications of synaptic strengths and permanent memory traces depending on subsequent events.
