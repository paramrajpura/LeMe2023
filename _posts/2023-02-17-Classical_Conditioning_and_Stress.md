Classical conditioning involves learning a new behavior by associating a cue to otherwise a naturally evoked response. 
The learning occurs by pairing a cue (Conditional Stimuli-CS) with a biologically significant cue (Unconditioned Stimuli-US) that would evoke a response (Unconditioned Response-UR) naturally without training. After training with paired cues, even in the absence of US, CS evokes the same response, called Conditioned Response(CR).

An interesting relation between stress and learning is observed, particularly in the classical conditioning paradigm for rats. Contrary to the findings in operant conditioning, often termed as learned helplessness, where stress impairs learning, stress facilitates classical conditioning. Work by Tracey Shors (1992,2001,2004,2022) demonstrates that if the training begins immediately after stress exposure, conditioning is enhanced, just as it is if training begins a day later. Furthermore, these results have investigated that the enhanced conditioning is not due to enhancing the motor output or performance of the response under stress. I wonder how stress can be selectively helpful to facilitate learning in education! And that's not all! Surprisingly, if the same stress-induced classical conditioning was performed on female rats, the results were found to be exactly the opposite! 

These findings have inspired works to investigate the performance and changes in behavior after experiencing a traumatic, stressful event. When the rats were exposed to cues associated with the stressful event days after the effect of stress would have ceased, males, when reintroduced to the stress context, were further enhanced in their performance, whereas females were further impaired. The findings in rats may not be extrapolated right away for humans, but it is worth wondering!
