## The Quest for understanding learning: Aplysia and Eric Kandel's works

To study learning mechanisms, one needs to identify the simple circuits in the brain that can help establish controlled experiments. 
However, the human brain with 100 billion neurons is not the best option, and neither are other mammalian organisms like rats, rabbits, 
and cats that were earlier used for behavioral experiments. That's when 70 years ago, Angelique Arvanitaki, a student working on a Mediterranean species, 
identified the neurons' features in Aplysia. The neurons in Aplysia are large, accessible, and easily identifiable. Since the mappings were now possible, 
scientists identified the connections of nerve cells that control gill and siphon withdrawal. The network was similar across the species, so the 
researchers started to examine the change in neurons as a function of the animal's experience. This unraveled the mechanisms of non-associative 
learning like habituation and sensitization.

Fun fact: Aplysia comes from the Latin word L'Aplysia â€” "that which one cannot wash." They are also called sea hares due to their appearance.

The works from multiple researchers, primarily Eric Kandel, demonstrated the circuits and exact mechanisms of habituation and sensitization in Aplysia. 
The conclusion was that habituation results from a decreased excitatory drive in reflexes and not an increased inhibition. Similarly, sensitization and 
dishabituation are the results of a common heterosynaptic facilitatory process that excites the synapse between sensory and motor neurons.
