The question "Do place cells encode just places?" draws forth the point these cells have more complex functions beyond their original discovery. Place cells were first discovered by John O'Keefe and Jonathan Dostrovsky in 1971, who found that certain neurons in the hippocampus of rats fired selectively when the rats were in specific locations, forming a "map" of the environment. Likewise, grid cells were discovered by Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser, and their colleagues in 2005, who found that certain neurons in the entorhinal cortex of rats fired in a hexagonal grid pattern, providing a spatial framework for navigation.

However, subsequent research has revealed that place and grid cells have more complex functions beyond spatial representation. For example, some studies have suggested that place cells may also be involved in memory consolidation and retrieval, context-dependent learning, and even social interaction, such as tracking the locations and movements of other individuals. Additionally, recent research has suggested that grid cells may play a role in representing non-spatial, abstract concepts, such as time or numerosity, as well as in navigation in virtual reality environments.

One study that supports the idea that place cells have multiple functions beyond place representation is a 2021 study by Benna et al[1]. The researchers propose that place cells may simply be a consequence of a memory compression process implemented in the hippocampus. They show that a simple neural network model that can efficiently compress information naturally produces place cells that are similar to those observed in experiments. It predicts that the activity of these cells is variable and that the fluctuations of the place fields encode information about the recent history of sensory experiences.

While an interesting alternative to the current approach is presented in the review study by Farzanfar et al.[2]. They propose that experiences during navigation with many similarly structured environments give rise to the formation of spatial schemas (for example, the expected layout of modern cities) that share properties with but are distinct from cognitive maps (for example, the memory of a modern city) and event schemas (such as expected events in a modern city) at both cognitive and neural levels. To elaborate on the concepts like schemas and cognitive maps, a cognitive map is a mental representation of a physical space that can range from detailed to general while a schema is a collection of general knowledge extracted from multiple cognitive maps. Schemas are formed by combining repetitive experiences and predictions of future events. So the overall conlcusion of their study is that overlapping features of different environments create prototypical spatial forms that guide navigation in new surroundings.

In summary, while place and grid cells were initially discovered for their role in spatial representation, subsequent research has shown that these cells have more complex and varied functions beyond their original discovery. These findings highlight the importance of continued research into these cell types and their contributions to cognitive processes beyond navigation.
