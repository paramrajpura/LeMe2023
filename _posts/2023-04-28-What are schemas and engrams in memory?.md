In Neuroscience, two concepts often discussed in the field are schema and engrams, which refer to different memory formation and processing aspects. While both concepts relate to how our brain encodes and retrieves information, they differ in several critical ways. This blog will explore the differences between schema and engrams in neuroscience.

A schema is a mental framework that helps us organize and interpret incoming information. A schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps us organize and interpret information based on past experiences. In other words, schemas are mental models that help us make sense of new information by relating it to existing knowledge. For example, suppose you have a schema for “restaurant” that includes specific elements, such as menus, tables, wait staff, and food. In that case, you can quickly understand the concept of a new restaurant by adding it to your existing schema. As we navigate the world and encounter new situations, we update and adjust our schemas to incorporate new experiences and knowledge.
On the other hand, an engram is a physical change in the brain that occurs when a memory is formed. Every time we experience something new, neurons in different areas of the brain activate and communicate, creating a unique pattern of activity that represents the memory of that experience. These activity patterns are referred to as engrams, and over time, they become more robust, making it easier for us to recall the memory later. Engrams are not static; they continue to change and evolve as we learn more about the world and experience new things. Additionally, schemas can be shared by groups of people and may differ from person to person, while engrams are unique to each individual and their specific memory. 
Schemas are based on previous experiences and knowledge and can be adapted and modified as we learn new things. For example, as we age, our schemas for certain concepts, such as “friendship” or “romance,” may change as we gain new experiences and perspectives. Engrams, on the other hand, don’t change significantly once they are formed. While they may be refined and strengthened over time, the essential pattern of activity that represents a particular memory remains relatively stable.
Finally, schema and engrams differ in their usefulness for understanding different aspects of memory. Schemas help us know how we organize and interpret incoming information, while engrams are more helpful in understanding the physical processes involved in memory formation and retrieval. 

Some experimental techniques used to identify schema in neuroscience are brain imaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), which can show brain activity during different cognitive tasks related to the schema. They are also studied using lesion studies. However, engrams are identified with Immediate Early Gene (IEG) expression, Calcium imaging, Optogenetics, and Fos labeling.

In conclusion, schema and engrams are two critical concepts in neuroscience that relate to different aspects of memory formation and processing. While there are similarities between the two concepts, including their role in memory, they differ in nature, adaptability, identification techniques, and usefulness for understanding different aspects of memory.
