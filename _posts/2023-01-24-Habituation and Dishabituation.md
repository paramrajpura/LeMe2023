When discussing the study of behavior, one can consider learning to be a change in behavior. The simplest ways to study learning can then start with reflexes or modal action patterns (MAPs). MAPs are specialised reflexes observed in particular species. So what sort of changes in MAPs can one study?

One of the simplest ways to study changes in behavior is to provide repeated stimulation and observer its effects. The study process may seem simple, but the mechanisms are not! When one learns not to respond to such repeated stimuli, it's called habituation. Even today, after 100+ years, researchers are involved in understanding habituation. A fascinating characteristic of habituation is stimulus generalization. It's worth pondering underlying neural processes that lead to the habituation to generalize across similar stimuli. What are the factors that decide the extent of generalization?!

Habituation also recovers depending on the time between the last and the current stimulus. Spontaneous recovery is the process of restrengthening the weakened response due to repetition. However, if a loud, distinct stimulus is provided after habituation, the behavior seems to recover. This renewal of response is called dishabituation.

If habituation recovers, what difference does repeated stimulation of the long term create? Interestingly, the rate of habituation after recovery increases the longer the stimulus is repeated and is spaced with increasing durations.
